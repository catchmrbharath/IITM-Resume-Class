This is the work of Siddharth Shekhar and I am trying to publicize it and make
it better. If you end up improving it, please send a pull request so that all
of us can use it.

This is a readme file that will help you to use the mycv.cls file so that you
can create a resume in LaTeX based on the standard insititute template. Please
don't forget to keep the logo.ps and the mycv.cls file in the same folder as
the one you are writing your .tex file in.

* Include the class file by typing ``\documentclass{mycv}``
* To write your name, use ``\author{<name>}``
* To write your roll number, use ``\RollNumber{<RollNo>}``
* To write your address, use ``\Address{<address>}``
* To write your phone number, use ``\PhoneNumber{<Phone Number>}``
* To write your email id, use ``\Email{<id>}``
* To create a new section with an underlined title, use ``\section{<Title>}``
* To create the first level of indentation without dates, use
``\subsection{<Title>}``. To create one with dates, use
``\datedsubsection{<Title>}``.
* To create the second level of indentation, use

```
\Point{
data
}
```
Please stick to this format because I've adjusted the indentation for this
format and this will also make your code more readable so that you can easily
make changes to it later.
* To create the table for filling out the educational details, use
``\begin{Education}`` data ``\end{Education}``. Note that the first row has
already been filled out for you, and you only need to start from the BTech...
line. Also, data has to be filled in using
``\EduDetails{CourseName}{Institution}{CGPA}{YearOfPassing}``.
* To create a two-column structure for filling in coursework, use the
``\begin{Course}`` data ``\end{Course}`` format. Note that once in the Course
environment, you use the \Point command as described previously to enter any
data that you need. You do not need to worry about the indentation or the
formatting or anything of that sort. The code should take care of it for you.
* Finally, to compile, use ``$ latex <yourfile>.tex`` (where <yourfile> is the
name of your .tex file) from the command line. You should already have the
latex command if you have LyX installed.

If you run into any bugs/problems, either let us know through mail, or open
an issue in github.

Yours,
